kill myself
hurt myself
suicide
can't take it
not sleeping
affairs in order
hopeless
desperate
trapped
want to die
demons
depressed
depression
devastated
end my life
end it all
commit suicide
take an overdose
suicidal
despair
ending it all
ultimate sacrifice
persecuted
doesn't want to live
do not want to live 
don't want to live
better of without me
let them down
let people down
my fault
ashamed
afraid
I'm just tired
I just want to be done
I just want to sleep
I can't keep doing this
I just want to be alone
I want to go home
promise to take care of
I'm just stressed out
having a hard time
no one cares
I don't care
can't imagine living 
What will heaven be like
"You know I love you, right"
want to disappear
